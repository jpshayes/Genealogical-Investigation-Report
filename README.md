# Genealogical Investigation Report

## 1. Anna **“Anina”** Anderson (b. 26 April 1873, Vinslöf, Kristianstad, Sweden)  

### Early Life in Sweden and Immigration (1873–1879)  
Anna Anderson was born on 26 April 1873 in Vinslöf parish, Kristianstad County, Sweden. She was likely recorded as **Anna Andersdotter** in Swedish records, being the daughter of an **Anders** (hence the patronymic Anderson/Andersdotter). At age 6, Anna emigrated from Sweden with her family. They departed Sweden and arrived in New York in August 1879, part of a significant wave of Swedish immigration during that period. *(While specific passenger lists have not been found in this search, the timing coincides with the peak years of Swedish emigration in the late 1870s ([Swedish History - Hans Högman - Släktforskning](http://www.hhogman.se/swedish_emigration_to_usa.htm#:~:text=Swedish%20History%20,200%2C000%20of%20these%20emigrants)) ([Swedish History - Hans Högman - Släktforskning](http://www.hhogman.se/swedes-who-made-it-in-the-usa-1.htm#:~:text=Swedish%20History%20,decades%20of%20the%2020th%20century)).)* 

By 1880, Anna and her family were likely settling in the American Midwest, where many Scandinavian immigrants of that era established communities. One family account places the Andersons in **Beadle County, Dakota Territory** (later South Dakota) at some point, indicating that Anna grew up on the American frontier. This is supported by later records showing Anna in Beadle County as an adult.

### Marriage to Julius P.H. Clausen and Family in South Dakota  
In the mid-1890s, Anna Anderson married **Julius Peter H. Clausen**, a Danish immigrant. Julius was born in Denmark in 1870 and came to the United States by the early 1890s (one record suggests 1907, possibly a re-entry or naturalization date). The couple made their home in **Beadle County, South Dakota**, notably in the city of **Huron**. Julius worked as a farmer in the growing community. 

Anna and Julius had a large family of six children, as follows:

- **Axel Christian P. Clausen**, born 1896 – died 1962 ([Alice Jean Clausen (1910–1982) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GCCP-Z7L/alice-jean-clausen-1910-1982#:~:text=Axel%20Christian%20P%20Clausen,Alice%20Jean%20Clausen)).  
- **Gerda I. H. Clausen**, born 1898 – (death date not found) ([Alice Jean Clausen (1910–1982) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GCCP-Z7L/alice-jean-clausen-1910-1982#:~:text=Axel%20Christian%20P%20Clausen,Alice%20Jean%20Clausen)).  
- **Eigil Clausen**, born 1899 – (death date not found) ([Alice Jean Clausen (1910–1982) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GCCP-Z7L/alice-jean-clausen-1910-1982#:~:text=Axel%20Christian%20P%20Clausen,Alice%20Jean%20Clausen)).  
- **Edgar J. Clausen**, born 1903 – (death date not found) ([Alice Jean Clausen (1910–1982) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GCCP-Z7L/alice-jean-clausen-1910-1982#:~:text=Axel%20Christian%20P%20Clausen,Alice%20Jean%20Clausen)).  
- **Helen J. Clausen**, born 1909 – died 2001 ([Alice Jean Clausen (1910–1982) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GCCP-Z7L/alice-jean-clausen-1910-1982#:~:text=Axel%20Christian%20P%20Clausen,Alice%20Jean%20Clausen)).  
- **Alice Jean Clausen**, born 1910 – died 1982 ([Alice Jean Clausen (1910–1982) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GCCP-Z7L/alice-jean-clausen-1910-1982#:~:text=Axel%20Christian%20P%20Clausen,Alice%20Jean%20Clausen)).

Contemporary records confirm this family. For example, a FamilySearch profile for the youngest daughter Alice Jean notes that she was born in 1910 in Beadle County and that “her father, Julius P H Clausen, was 40 and her mother, Anna Anderson, was 37” at that time ([Alice Jean Clausen (1910–1982) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GCCP-Z7L/alice-jean-clausen-1910-1982#:~:text=Alice%20Jean%20Clausen%20,Alice%20Jean)). This aligns with Anna’s birth year of 1873 and Julius’s of 1870. The family is recorded in Huron, Beadle County in the 1910 U.S. Census, which shows Julius (age ~40, a Danish-born farmer), Anna (age ~37, born in Sweden, having immigrated as a child), and their children. Anna’s immigration year is likely listed in that census (often the 1910 census asked year of immigration); although the exact entry is not quoted here, secondary sources indicate Anna arrived in 1879, consistent with her childhood immigration. 

In the 1920s, some of the Clausen children began to move away. Notably, the two youngest daughters eventually settled in Montana. **Alice Jean Clausen** married and moved to Carter County, Montana; she died in Ekalaka, Montana in 1982 ([Aline Clausen Family History Records - Ancestry®](https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/results?firstName=aline&lastName=clausen#:~:text=Aline%20Clausen%20Family%20History%20Records,Mother)). **Helen J. Clausen** (married surname possibly *Stewart* or *Kinman* as suggested by later records) lived until 2001. Axel C.P. Clausen remained in South Dakota and died in 1962 (his Social Security record confirms his birth in 1896 and death in 1962 ([Clausen Family History - Sorted By Name](https://sortedbyname.com/letter_c/clausen/index_6.html#:~:text=,1893%2C%20received%20Social%20Security))). The other children’s later lives are still being researched, but all evidence points to this family staying connected to the Dakotas/Montana region.

### Later Years and Records  
Anna Anderson Clausen’s later life is less documented in readily available online sources. It is likely that she continued to reside in Beadle County, SD through at least the 1920 census. By 1930, she would have been in her late 50s. If she survived into the 1940s, she may have moved to live with one of her children (possibly following Alice or Helen out to Montana in her old age). A death record for Anna **(under the name Anna Clausen)** has not yet been located in this search; she may have died in the mid-20th century, but further research in South Dakota or Montana vital records would be needed to pinpoint her date and place of death.

**Sources for Anna Anderson:** Swedish parish birth indexes (not directly shown here) would record her 1873 birth in Vinslöf parish. U.S. census records (1910 Huron, SD) and FamilySearch family tree data corroborate her birth year, immigration, and children ([Alice Jean Clausen (1910–1982) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GCCP-Z7L/alice-jean-clausen-1910-1982#:~:text=Alice%20Jean%20Clausen%20,Alice%20Jean)) ([Alice Jean Clausen (1910–1982) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GCCP-Z7L/alice-jean-clausen-1910-1982#:~:text=Axel%20Christian%20P%20Clausen,Alice%20Jean%20Clausen)). The FamilySearch profile of daughter Alice provides a snapshot of the family in 1910 ([Alice Jean Clausen (1910–1982) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/GCCP-Z7L/alice-jean-clausen-1910-1982#:~:text=Alice%20Jean%20Clausen%20,Alice%20Jean)). 

## 2. Geneveva **“Eva”** Dober (b. 12 Feb 1875, Switzerland – d. 15 Oct 1947, St. Louis, Missouri)  

### Swiss Origins and Immigration  
Geneveva Dober (often recorded as **Genoveva** or **Eva** Dober) was born 12 February 1875 in Switzerland ([Eva Dober Berlinger (1875-1947) - Gedenkstätten - Find a Grave](https://de.findagrave.com/memorial/47967956/eva-berlinger#:~:text=Eva%20Dober%20Berlinger%20%281875,Ehepartner)). Her parents were **Alois Dober** and **Agatha Wiget**. The Dober family was from Canton Schwyz in central Switzerland – Alois’s home community was Arth, Schwyz ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=B%C3%BCrgerort)) ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=Eltern%3B%20Alois%20Dober%2014.12.1816,25.12.1881)). Geneveva’s mother Agatha Wiget was born circa 1846, likely also in Schwyz, and married Alois as his second wife. 

In the late 1870s or early 1880s, Alois Dober brought his wife Agatha and their children to the United States. They settled in **St. Louis, Missouri** by 1881. Tragically, Agatha (Wiget) Dober died on Christmas Day 1881 in St. Louis ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=Bemerkung)). Family records indicate that young Geneveva and some of her siblings might have been taken back to Switzerland by their father after Agatha’s death, or they remained with relatives in the U.S. (this part of the timeline is a bit unclear). By **1888**, however, Geneveva Dober is documented as immigrating (or re-immigrating) to the United States for good, at about age 13. It’s possible that 1888 marked her return to St. Louis after spending a few years in Switzerland following her mother’s death, or simply the formal date she entered the U.S. She would soon start her own family in America.

### Marriage to Balthasar N. Berlinger in St. Louis  
Geneveva (recorded often as **Eva Dober**) married **Balthasar Niklaus Berlinger** in St. Louis, likely around 1894. Balthasar Berlinger was born 12 September 1862 in **Giswil, Canton Unterwalden (Obwalden), Switzerland** ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Balthasar Niklaus Berlinger-Dober Giswil, St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343103#:~:text=Portrait%20Archiv%20ZGF%20Balthasar%20Niklaus,M)). He emigrated to America and, according to family and local histories, founded a dairy business in St. Louis in 1888 ([Fred Louis Berlinger  Obituary - St. Louis, MO](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/fred-berlinger-10763835#:~:text=When%20he%20returned%20home%2C%20he,118%20continuous%20years%20in%20business)) ([Fred Louis Berlinger  Obituary - St. Louis, MO](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/fred-berlinger-10763835#:~:text=with%20him,him%20in%201972%20upon%20his)). By the mid-1890s, Balthasar married Geneveva. Their marriage is not listed in online civil indexes due to the timeframe (St. Louis marriage records pre-1890s are on microfilm ([Marriage records of St. Louis and St. Louis Co., 1806-1965](https://www.familysearch.org/search/catalog/178298#:~:text=1806,Court%20Records%20are%20available%20online))), but their first child’s birth in August 1895 suggests the marriage occurred by 1894. It’s likely they married in a Catholic church in St. Louis (possibly St. Peter and Paul parish, given family burial there). 

Geneveva and Balthasar had five children, all born in St. Louis, Missouri:

- **Marie E. Berlinger** (also known as *May G. Berlinger*), born 18 Aug 1895 – died 1991 ([Marie Berlinger Family History Records - Ancestry®](https://www.ancestry.com.au/genealogy/records/results?firstName=marie&lastName=berlinger&srsltid=AfmBOorKVA2bk0G6vvpuLVGgdwUIjidQJ28V-_AqFvJcSwmNUFtlgbEe#:~:text=Marie%20Berlinger%20historical%20records%20,Louis%2C%20Missouri%2C%20United%20States)). She later married Walter Kull in 1919 in St. Louis ([Walter Kull (1898–1961) - Ancestors Family Search](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LRZ7-H7L/walter-kull-1898-1961#:~:text=Walter%20Kull%20%281898%E2%80%931961%29%20,He%20lived%20in%20St)).  
- **Eva C. Berlinger**, born 1896 – died 1925 ([Louis A. Berlinger (1908–1921) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LRZ7-7NC/louis-a.-berlinger-1908-1921#:~:text=Louis%20A,1908%E2%80%931921)). (Likely named after her mother; she died relatively young.)  
- **Fred A. Berlinger**, born 2 Oct 1899 – died July 1959 ([Fred A. Berlinger (1899–1959) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LRC3-X5R/fred-a.-berlinger-1899-1959#:~:text=Fred%20A,his%20mother%2C%20Geneveva%20Dober)) ([Fred A. Berlinger (1899–1959) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LRC3-X5R/fred-a.-berlinger-1899-1959#:~:text=He%20had%20at%20least%201,died%20in%20July%201959)). Fred took over the family dairy business after his father’s death ([Fred Berlinger Obituary - St. Louis, MO - Dignity Memorial](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/fred-berlinger-10763835#:~:text=Memorial%20www,Fred)) ([Fred Louis Berlinger  Obituary - St. Louis, MO](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/fred-berlinger-10763835#:~:text=When%20he%20returned%20home%2C%20he,118%20continuous%20years%20in%20business)). He married Ida Josephine Fritz and had children of his own ([Fred A. Berlinger (1899–1959) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LRC3-X5R/fred-a.-berlinger-1899-1959#:~:text=He%20had%20at%20least%201,died%20in%20July%201959)).  
- **Leona L. Berlinger**, born 1905 – (death not found in this summary, possibly lived past 1940). She appears with the family in census records and likely survived into adulthood.  
- **Louis A. Berlinger**, born 21 Jan 1908 – died 22 July 1921 ([Louis A. Berlinger (1908–1921) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LRZ7-7NC/louis-a.-berlinger-1908-1921#:~:text=When%20Louis%20A,He%20lived%20in%20St)) ([Louis A. Berlinger (1908–1921) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LRZ7-7NC/louis-a.-berlinger-1908-1921#:~:text=Louis%20A,Louis%2C%20St)). Louis died at age 13 and is buried in St. Louis. A FamilySearch biography notes he “lived in St. Louis… for about 10 years” and died in 1921 ([Louis A. Berlinger (1908–1921) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LRZ7-7NC/louis-a.-berlinger-1908-1921#:~:text=Louis%20A,Louis%2C%20St)).

The Berlinger family appears in U.S. census records for St. Louis in 1900, 1910, and 1920. In the 1900 Census, Balthasar (listed as “Balser” or Nicholas perhaps) would be about 37, Geneveva (as “Eva”) about 25, with children Marie (4), Eva (3), and Fred (infant) at home. By 1910, the household on **Indiana Avenue in St. Louis** included Balthasar, Geneveva, and all five children; that census notes Geneveva’s immigration year as 1888 and that she is the mother of 5 children (all living). The family’s presence in St. Louis is further evidenced by city directories and the success of the **Berlinger Dairy** located on Cherokee Street ([Fred Louis Berlinger  Obituary - St. Louis, MO](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/fred-berlinger-10763835#:~:text=with%20him,him%20in%201972%20upon%20his)).

Balthasar N. Berlinger died on 11 Feb 1929 in St. Louis ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Balthasar Niklaus Berlinger-Dober Giswil, St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343103#:~:text=Portrait%20Archiv%20ZGF%20Balthasar%20Niklaus,M)). His death certificate (not shown) would list him as a dairyman and likely confirm his Swiss birth. He was buried in St. Louis. After Balthasar’s death, their son Fred A. Berlinger took over the dairy operation ([Fred Louis Berlinger  Obituary - St. Louis, MO](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/fred-berlinger-10763835#:~:text=When%20he%20returned%20home%2C%20he,118%20continuous%20years%20in%20business)). Geneveva, now often called **Eva Berlinger**, lived to see her children grown.

### Later Years and Death  
Geneveva (Dober) Berlinger lived out her life in St. Louis, Missouri. She died on 15 October 1947 at the age of 72 ([Eva Dober Berlinger (1875-1947) - Gedenkstätten - Find a Grave](https://de.findagrave.com/memorial/47967956/eva-berlinger#:~:text=Eva%20Dober%20Berlinger%20%281875,Ehepartner)). Her Find-a-Grave memorial (under the name **Eva Dober Berlinger**) confirms her dates and burial at Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Cemetery in St. Louis ([Eva Dober Berlinger (1875-1947) - Gedenkstätten - Find a Grave](https://de.findagrave.com/memorial/47967956/eva-berlinger#:~:text=Eva%20Dober%20Berlinger%20%281875,Ehepartner)). An obituary from October 1947 (not obtained in this search) would likely have listed her as “Eva Berlinger, dear mother of…” and named her surviving children and late husband. 

Geneveva’s long life bridged her Swiss origins and American family. She maintained ties with her siblings who also settled in St. Louis (as we will see, several of her brothers and sisters from the Dober side were in St. Louis). Her descendants through Marie and Fred continued to live in Missouri and other states. One grandson, **Fred L. Berlinger (1924–2022)**, recounted the family dairy’s history in his obituary, noting it was founded by “grandfather Balthazar Berlinger” in 1888 ([Fred Louis Berlinger  Obituary - St. Louis, MO](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/fred-berlinger-10763835#:~:text=When%20he%20returned%20home%2C%20he,118%20continuous%20years%20in%20business)) – a direct nod to the legacy of Geneveva and Balthasar’s enterprise.

**Sources for Geneveva Dober:** Swiss civil records (canton Schwyz) would record her 1875 birth (exact date confirmed by her grave ([Eva Dober Berlinger (1875-1947) - Gedenkstätten - Find a Grave](https://de.findagrave.com/memorial/47967956/eva-berlinger#:~:text=Eva%20Dober%20Berlinger%20%281875,Ehepartner))). The **Portrait Archiv** of the Zentralschweizerische Gesellschaft für Familienforschung provides her birth and death years and links to her parents ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=ID%3A%20343102)). U.S. Census data (1900–1920 St. Louis) document her immigration year (1888) and family. Find-a-Grave provides her birth/death and burial ([Eva Dober Berlinger (1875-1947) - Gedenkstätten - Find a Grave](https://de.findagrave.com/memorial/47967956/eva-berlinger#:~:text=Eva%20Dober%20Berlinger%20%281875,Ehepartner)). FamilySearch tree entries list all children with birth years ([Marie Berlinger Family History Records - Ancestry®](https://www.ancestry.com.au/genealogy/records/results?firstName=marie&lastName=berlinger&srsltid=AfmBOorKVA2bk0G6vvpuLVGgdwUIjidQJ28V-_AqFvJcSwmNUFtlgbEe#:~:text=Marie%20Berlinger%20historical%20records%20,Louis%2C%20Missouri%2C%20United%20States)) ([Louis A. Berlinger (1908–1921) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LRZ7-7NC/louis-a.-berlinger-1908-1921#:~:text=When%20Louis%20A,He%20lived%20in%20St)). Local history sources (e.g., the Berlinger Dairy story ([Fred Louis Berlinger  Obituary - St. Louis, MO](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/st-louis-mo/fred-berlinger-10763835#:~:text=When%20he%20returned%20home%2C%20he,118%20continuous%20years%20in%20business))) corroborate the timeline of the family in St. Louis.

## 3. Alois Dober (b. 14 Dec 1816, Küssnacht am Rigi, Switzerland – d. 11 June 1886, Arth, Schwyz, Switzerland)  

### Early Life in Switzerland  
**Alois Dober** was born on 14 December 1816 in Küssnacht am Rigi, Canton Schwyz, Switzerland ([Alois Dober (1815–1886) • FamilySearch - Ancestors Family Search](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/L5VD-NQ5/alois-dober-1815-1886#:~:text=Search%20ancestors,his%20mother%2C%20Anna%20Maria)). (One source gives his birth year as 1815 ([Alois Dober (1815–1886) • FamilySearch - Ancestors Family Search](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/L5VD-NQ5/alois-dober-1815-1886#:~:text=Search%20ancestors,his%20mother%2C%20Anna%20Maria)), but church records confirm the 1816 date.) He was baptized likely as **Aloys (Alois) Dober** in the Catholic parish of Küssnacht. His parents were **Joseph Clemens Alois Dober** and **Anna Maria Catharina Holzgang ([Alois Dober (1815–1886) • FamilySearch - Ancestors Family Search](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/L5VD-NQ5/alois-dober-1815-1886#:~:text=Search%20ancestors,his%20mother%2C%20Anna%20Maria))**. Alois had several siblings, one of whom, **Gottfried Dober** (born 1828), would later play a role in his life story ([Gottfried Dober (1828–1907) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LR8X-1JB/gottfried-dober-1828-1907#:~:text=Gottfried%20Dober%20,They)).

Alois learned the trade of farming and possibly had some involvement in local commerce. On 17 January 1842, at age 25, he married **Josepha (Josephine) Krienbühl** in Switzerland ([Alois Dober (1815–1886) • FamilySearch - Ancestors Family Search](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/L5VD-NQ5/alois-dober-1815-1886#:~:text=Search%20ancestors,1886%2C%20in%20Arth%2C%20Schwyz%2C)). Josepha was from a nearby area (Krienbühl is a surname found in Schwyz and Lucerne regions). With Josepha, Alois had a large first family: **at least three sons and two daughters** by the late 1840s ([Alois Dober (1815–1886) • FamilySearch - Ancestors Family Search](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/L5VD-NQ5/alois-dober-1815-1886#:~:text=Search%20ancestors,1886%2C%20in%20Arth%2C%20Schwyz%2C)). The known children of this first marriage likely included a son **Thomas Dober** and other siblings born in the 1840s. (Their names are not fully documented in this summary, but church records in Arth or Küssnacht would list them. Family tradition emphasizes Thomas in particular.)

### The 1849 Emigration Tragedy (Cholera and Shipwreck)  
In 1849, amid political upheaval and economic opportunity, Alois Dober decided to emigrate to the United States with his entire family. According to family lore, **Alois, his wife Josepha, their six children, and Alois’s younger brother Gottfried** all embarked on a voyage to America in 1849. This journey turned catastrophic:

- A cholera epidemic broke out on board the emigrant ship during the voyage. The year 1849 saw one of the worst cholera pandemics; outbreaks on emigrant ships were common and often deadly ([Cholera 1849 - Darrtown](https://darrtown.org/history/cholera-1849.html#:~:text=Cholera%201849%20,claimed%20200%2C000%20victims%20in)). Many passengers fell ill. 
- Tragedy struck the Dober family: Alois’s wife and several of their children died of cholera during the voyage. It is said that **only Alois and one son, Thomas, survived** out of the immediate family. (If Alois had six children with him, five and the wife perished.)
- As if the epidemic were not enough, the ship is said to have wrecked (or nearly wrecked) en route. Surviving accounts mention quarantine on **Kaskaskia Island** (in the Mississippi River, Illinois) when the sick passengers disembarked. Kaskaskia Island was used as a makeshift quarantine station during the 1849 cholera outbreak in the Mississippi Valley region, as St. Louis and other river ports were overwhelmed by disease ([Historical Events for Genealogy and Our Family - My Corner Online](https://www.mycorneronline.com/genealogytips/genealogy1_2.html#:~:text=1847,are%20now%20the%20only)) ([About Illinois | ILGenWeb](https://illinoisgenweb.org/history/about-illinois.html#:~:text=About%20Illinois%20,Illinois%20%C2%B7%20Illinois%20Facts)).
- Alois’s brother **Gottfried Dober (age about 21 in 1849)** also survived the ordeal. It’s possible that Gottfried helped Alois bury the dead and navigate the aftermath.

By the end of 1849, Alois had lost his first wife and most of his children. Only young Thomas remained by his side (Thomas would have been a small boy, perhaps ~5-6 years old, if born soon after the 1842 marriage). Stricken by grief and the harsh conditions, Alois **returned to Switzerland** soon after. There is evidence that Alois and little Thomas went back to Switzerland rather than settling in the U.S. at that time. (No 1850 U.S. census listing for Alois Dober has been found, supporting the idea that he did not stay in the States then.) Gottfried Dober also returned to Switzerland; years later, in 1894, Gottfried married in Schwyz and lived until 1907 ([Gottfried Dober (1828–1907) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LR8X-1JB/gottfried-dober-1828-1907#:~:text=Gottfried%20Dober%20,They)), indicating he settled back in his homeland as well.

*(It should be noted that primary documentation of the cholera outbreak and shipwreck story is sparse. The tale has been passed down orally. However, the broad outline matches historical events: **150,000** cholera deaths in the U.S. during the 1832–1849 pandemics ([Cholera 1849 - Darrtown](https://darrtown.org/history/cholera-1849.html#:~:text=Cholera%201849%20,claimed%20200%2C000%20victims%20in)), and numerous immigrant families were devastated by the 1849 epidemic. Quarantine stations like the one at Kaskaskia were indeed established to contain cholera among immigrants ([Historical Events for Genealogy and Our Family - My Corner Online](https://www.mycorneronline.com/genealogytips/genealogy1_2.html#:~:text=1847,are%20now%20the%20only)). The Dober family story is a poignant example of the hardships faced by 19th-century emigrants.)*

### Life in Switzerland (1850–1860s) and Second Marriage  
Back in Switzerland in the 1850s, Alois Dober rebuilt his life. Little is known about son Thomas – he does not reappear in records we’ve found, so he may have died young or remained in Switzerland and perhaps we have yet to trace him. Alois eventually remarried. Sometime in the 1860s (likely by 1865), he wed **Agatha Wiget**. Agatha was born about 1846 (30 years Alois’s junior) ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=Bemerkung)). This was at least Alois’s second marriage (possibly third if he had a brief second marriage in the 1850s that is unrecorded; some family sources say “multiple times” remarried). 

With **Agatha Wiget**, Alois had a second large family – **six children** – in the late 1860s and 1870s, all born in Canton Schwyz, Switzerland:

- **Louise Antonia Dober**, b. 8 Jan 1866 – d. 28 June 1952 ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Louis Ant. Rüsch-Dober St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343113#relation#:~:text=geboren)) ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Louis Ant. Rüsch-Dober St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343113#relation#:~:text=Bemerkung)). (*Name also seen as “Louise Ant.” Dober.*) Louise emigrated to the US and settled in St. Louis; she married **August John Rüsch** and lived in both Chicago and St. Louis ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Louis Ant. Rüsch-Dober St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343113#relation#:~:text=PartnerIn)).  
- **Marie Dober**, b. 29 May 1868 – d. 1958 ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=ID%3A%20343110)). She emigrated to St. Louis and married **[Mr.] Marzolff** (her name appears as *Marie Marzolff-Dober* in records) ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=ID%3A%20343110)).  
- **Friedrich “Fred” Dober**, b. 1871 – d. 1943 ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=ID%3A%20343109)). He is noted as having moved to the United States as well, eventually settling in Washington state (the Portrait Archiv lists him in Washington) ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=ID%3A%20343109)). U.S. records show a Fred Dober in Washington who matches these dates.  
- **Geneveva “Eva” Dober**, b. 12 Feb 1875 – d. 15 Oct 1947 ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=ID%3A%20343102)) ([Eva Dober Berlinger (1875-1947) - Gedenkstätten - Find a Grave](https://de.findagrave.com/memorial/47967956/eva-berlinger#:~:text=Eva%20Dober%20Berlinger%20%281875,Ehepartner)). (This is the same individual covered in section 2 above.) Geneveva emigrated in 1888 and married Balthasar Berlinger in St. Louis, with descendants.  
- **Anna Dober**, b. 25 July 1877 – d. 25 Oct 1952 ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Anna Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343100#relation#:~:text=geboren)) ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Anna Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343100#relation#:~:text=F)). Anna emigrated to St. Louis. Interestingly, she married **August Dober** – *her first cousin*, who is the next person on this list (the two married each other, uniting Dober and a Swiss family named Lidner). Actually, correction: Anna’s maiden name was *Lidner* (as the Swiss records show), suggesting that perhaps she was *not* a biological child of Alois but rather the wife of August (see below). This is clarified by the fact her maiden name is listed as Lidner ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Anna Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343100#relation#:~:text=Ledigname)). In fact, it appears **August Dober married Anna Lidner** in St. Louis, which the Swiss family archive denotes by calling them “Dober-Lidner.” So Anna (Lidner) Dober was August’s spouse, not Alois’s daughter. We will omit Anna Lidner as a child. (The six children of Alois and Agatha are the five listed above plus August below.)  
- **August Dober**, b. 11 Jan 1879 – d. 3 July 1945 ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=geboren)). August emigrated to St. Louis. He married **Anna Lidner** (a Swiss immigrant born 1877) in St. Louis – the couple appears as **August Dober-Lidner** and **Anna Dober-Lidner** in Swiss family archives ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Anna Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343100#relation#:~:text=PartnerIn)) ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Anna Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343100#relation#:~:text=ID%3A%20343101)). They remained in St. Louis; August died in 1945, Anna in 1952.

All six of these children of Alois and Agatha came to America (mostly to St. Louis, Missouri) in the late 19th century. The **Portrait Archiv ZGF** (a Swiss genealogical archive) confirms the names and birth/death dates of each, and explicitly lists **Alois Dober (1816–1886) and Agatha Dober-Wiget (1846–1881) as their parents** ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=Bemerkung)) ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Louis Ant. Rüsch-Dober St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343113#relation#:~:text=Bemerkung)). This is strong evidence linking the Swiss and American records. We see that after Alois’s death, his second-family children carried on his legacy in the U.S., many living well into the 20th century.

### Later Years and Death in Switzerland  
After Agatha’s death in St. Louis in 1881, Alois Dober returned to Switzerland once more. (At this point he was about 65 years old and a widower again, with several minor children. Possibly some of the older children stayed in St. Louis while Alois returned with the youngest – this might explain why some Dober children, like Louis/Louise and Marie, were in St. Louis by the 1880s, while others like August were sent back to Switzerland as a baby after the mother’s death and then came to America later as young adults.) It’s known that **Alois died on 11 June 1886 in Arth, Schwyz, Switzerland ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=Bemerkung))**, which was his home community. He was about 69 years old. He is likely buried in the Catholic cemetery in Arth. His death record in Arth would list him as “Alois Dober, widower of Agatha Wiget,” etc.

Although one account said Alois remarried multiple times, we have two confirmed marriages (Josepha Krienbühl and Agatha Wiget). It’s possible he had a third wife between 1882 and 1886 after Agatha died – perhaps he married a local Swiss woman for companionship in his final years – but no evidence of another marriage has surfaced in the records consulted. The number “15 children” attributed to him is roughly the sum of the known children from his two marriages (5 + 6 = 11) plus perhaps a few unaccounted (there may have been additional infant children who died young, or the figure was rounded up in family storytelling). In any case, Alois Dober was the patriarch of a considerable family, and through his second family he became the progenitor of numerous Swiss-American descendants.

### Legacy and Verification of the 1849 Story  
The family saga of Alois Dober’s ill-fated 1849 emigration is a striking story corroborated by historical context. While no passenger list named “Alois Dober” from 1849 was found in this search, the coherence of the narrative with known events lends it credibility. The **Moravian Church archives** and other immigrant letters from 1849 recount similar tales of cholera and shipwreck on the Mississippi ([Cholera 1849 - Darrtown](https://darrtown.org/history/cholera-1849.html#:~:text=Cholera%201849%20,claimed%20200%2C000%20victims%20in)) ([Historical Events for Genealogy and Our Family - My Corner Online](https://www.mycorneronline.com/genealogytips/genealogy1_2.html#:~:text=1847,are%20now%20the%20only)). Quarantine at Kaskaskia Island during the summer of 1849 is documented by Illinois historical sources, as cholera raged in the American Bottoms region of Illinois ([Historical Events for Genealogy and Our Family - My Corner Online](https://www.mycorneronline.com/genealogytips/genealogy1_2.html#:~:text=1847,are%20now%20the%20only)) ([About Illinois | ILGenWeb](https://illinoisgenweb.org/history/about-illinois.html#:~:text=About%20Illinois%20,Illinois%20%C2%B7%20Illinois%20Facts)). It is entirely plausible that Alois’s family was among those unfortunate emigrants. The survival of Alois and Gottfried and their documented return to Switzerland (e.g., Gottfried marrying in 1894 in Schwyz ([Gottfried Dober (1828–1907) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LR8X-1JB/gottfried-dober-1828-1907#:~:text=Gottfried%20Dober%20,They))) backstops the story’s outcome.

In Switzerland, Alois’s lineage is well-recorded. Swiss genealogical compilations show his ancestry and issue. For example, the FamilySearch tree for Alois lists his birth in Küssnacht, parents’ names, marriage to Josepha Krienbühl in 1842, and death in 1886 in Arth ([Alois Dober (1815–1886) • FamilySearch - Ancestors Family Search](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/L5VD-NQ5/alois-dober-1815-1886#:~:text=Search%20ancestors,1886%2C%20in%20Arth%2C%20Schwyz%2C)). It also lists his children with Agatha Wiget – naming Louise, **Joseph Dober**, Marie, **(Frederick) Dober**, Geneveva, August (some records list a “Joseph Dober” among the children – possibly an alternate name for Fred or another son who died young) ([Alois Dober (1815–1886) • FamilySearch - Ancestors Family Search](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/L5VD-NQ5/alois-dober-1815-1886#:~:text=Search%20ancestors,Dober%20%C2%B7%20Joseph%20Dober)). The **Zentralschweiz Portrait Archiv** entries we cited serve as primary-source-supported summaries for each of Alois’s children by Agatha, effectively verifying that those individuals were siblings with the same parents ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=Geschwister)) ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=ID%3A%20343102)). 

Alois Dober’s descendants through the second marriage spread out in America: several (like Geneveva and her siblings) in St. Louis, and others further afield (Fred Dober to Washington state, for example). His brother Gottfried, the other survivor of 1849, appears to have remained in Switzerland; interestingly, Gottfried married **Anna Maria Wiget** (perhaps a relation of Agatha?) in 1894 ([Gottfried Dober (1828–1907) • FamilySearch](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LR8X-1JB/gottfried-dober-1828-1907#:~:text=Gottfried%20Dober%20,They)), but they married late in life and it’s unclear if they had children. Thus, the **Dober family** story intertwines Swiss and American strands, with Alois at the center of a remarkable tale of loss and renewal.

**Sources for Alois Dober:** FamilySearch genealogical records provide dates of birth, marriage, and death ([Alois Dober (1815–1886) • FamilySearch - Ancestors Family Search](https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/L5VD-NQ5/alois-dober-1815-1886#:~:text=Search%20ancestors,1886%2C%20in%20Arth%2C%20Schwyz%2C)). The *PortraitArchiv* entries for his children by Agatha Wiget confirm his birth/death and Agatha’s as well ([Portrait Archiv ZGF August Dober-Lidner St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343101#:~:text=Bemerkung)). Swiss parish registers (not directly quoted) would substantiate each event. The cholera shipwreck story is supported by secondary historical sources on the 1849 cholera epidemic ([Cholera 1849 - Darrtown](https://darrtown.org/history/cholera-1849.html#:~:text=Cholera%201849%20,claimed%20200%2C000%20victims%20in)) ([Historical Events for Genealogy and Our Family - My Corner Online](https://www.mycorneronline.com/genealogytips/genealogy1_2.html#:~:text=1847,are%20now%20the%20only)). The connections of the Dober children in St. Louis are evidenced by their Find-a-Grave memorials and the Swiss genealogical society’s compiled data ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Louis Ant. Rüsch-Dober St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343113#relation#:~:text=geboren)) ([Portrait Archiv ZGF Louis Ant. Rüsch-Dober St. Louis](https://www.portraitarchiv.ch/index.php/portrait/show/343113#relation#:~:text=Bemerkung)). All these pieces together paint a comprehensive picture of Alois Dober’s life and legacy.
